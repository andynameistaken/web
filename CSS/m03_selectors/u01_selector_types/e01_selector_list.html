            Selector list
            
            If you have more than one thing which uses
            the same CSS then the individual selectors can be combined
            into a selector list so that the rule is applied to all of
            the individual selector.
            If there is mistake in selector the entire rule is deemed invalid.
            
            
            Example:
            */
            h1,
            .special {
                color: blue;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Header 1</h1>
        
        <div class="special">
            div with special class
        </div>
